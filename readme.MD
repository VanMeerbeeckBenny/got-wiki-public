# PE02 - Game of Thrones Character Wiki

## Assignment
Create an application that displays a list of characters from Game of Thrones. Generate 'cards' containing character information, including:
- An image of the character
- The name of the character
- The name of the actor portraying the character

**The characters can be found in `datafile.js`. *(this file hase been removed but is pulled from an other repo)* **

The application should allow filtering in two ways:
- Filter characters based on royal status
- Filter characters based on their house

## Filtering Royals
Provide a way to choose between all characters, royals, and non-royals using **radio buttons**.

## Filtering Based on House
Each character belongs to a house. Display all characters for each house.

The choice is made using a **select** element.
